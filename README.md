# Linear Regression - House Price Prediction

## ðŸ“ŒObjective:
Implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Steps Performed:
1. Imported & Preprocessed Dataset
   - Loaded the house price dataset.
   - Handled missing values and selected relevant features.

2. Train-Test Split
   - Divided data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

3. Model Training
   - Applied LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model.
   - Built both simple and multiple regression models.

4. Evaluation
   - Used metrics: MAE, MSE, RÂ² score.
   - Checked model accuracy and error rates.

5. Visualization
   - Plotted regression line (for simple regression).
   - Plotted residuals histogram to check normality.
   - Plotted residuals vs predicted values to analyze variance.

### Key Learnings:
- How regression coefficients explain the relationship between features and target.
- How to evaluate models using MAE, MSE, RÂ².
- Residual analysis to validate regression assumptions.

### Tools Used:
- Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1230704.9331823809
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2784597954908.523
- RÂ² Score: 0.44909303478095464
